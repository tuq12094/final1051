## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I want to create a guessing game for the final project. Where you guess a word given a hint. If you get the word wrong, it will return another hint of the word.
I will most likely select the group of words(answers) to a specific category like TV shows or movies so that the game is captivating.
