# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

 #Mario

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

#I will create a mario game a little similar to the one we did in class. In making the pyramid at the end, I will use tiles, and I will also create a flagpole in which mario will cross and a victory message will display.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

#The primary basis of the software will be to create a climable tiled piramid for mario at the end of the level completed, and a flagpole that allows for a victory message to appear or transition to a new level. The pyramid will need to be symmetrical for the game to work and above the ground to allow for a close jump to the flagpole, like in mario. Flagpole sprites from the distro's sprite sheet and collision detection will be utilized. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

#Not planning on it.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

#Not planning on it.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

#A goofd outcome for me, will be to visualize mario up the pyramid. I know I will have trouble creatin g the victory message and transitioning to a new level. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

#I think I can accomplish at least mario moving through a round and completing it. But, may have trouble moving to the next. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

#The best outcome would be for me to complete the project to the fullest extent as explained in the assignment. I truly will be hoping for the best. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
#Ill need to examine the zip file that is given to me in the assignment and see how I can implement the sprites to the correct areas of the games, making sure not to do it before the level is ended. I will also need to analyze the scripts given to see where I need to build off of.
