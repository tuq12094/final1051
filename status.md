Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have analyzed the files given and been able to add the pyramid portion of the project to allow it to look like tiles like in the actual mario game.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I will still need to create a flagpole at the end of the level that allows for a victory message to appear. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

#No problems, still working though.
